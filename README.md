# Amacord Project

### motivation
+ I, Jon Berliner, grew up in a really abusive house.  One of the more sinister features of my childhood going still into current adulthood is gaslighting.  features include:
    + telling me that my stories never happened
    + attributing my lived experiences that are positive to my brothers, and my brothers' negative experiences to me (really!)
    + intentionally forgetting names
    + changing the subject to false things/repremanding nonsensically for not respecting mother
    + I learned to protect memories by shoving them keep down
        + this has led to a common phenomenon of worrying about early onset dimensia
            + Laura - when I forgot your name a few years back, it gutted me.  I slipped into a depress bout for weeks, worrying that every happy thing would be taken away from me - that everything period would be taken away until I was sitting there like James Kaan to Kathy Bates' 
    + I want them to come out so I can remember them for the murky beauty they are, rather than framed in defiance to abusers.
+ You guys gave me nearly all my happy memories.  I don't want stories about me.  I want to capture memories about US.
+ Help me process a ton of trauma by making something beautiful, rather than shaking our heads and telling how awful it was.

## What
+ shared document with stories.  getting details exact is NOT the point - do not argue over what happened.  Just add your angle to a shared experience.
+ If you see a story you were part of but remember it differently, add you're angle!  Have fun trying to figure out who was there, when it was, why we did it, why YOU personally did it.
+ Jump in to tag yourself - don't take offense if someone didn't tag you.  We love each other - I promise that if I missed you, it's not because I think less of you.  I just didn't remember, and will be that much happier to be reminded that I shared an experience with YOU also.
+ they don't need to include me.  Watch with wonder how just being brought back to certain contexts will open up more opportunities for memories to pour out
+ DON'T try to remember the whole thing - the point is that we can put in small individual efforts, and put together a rich picture of a shared lived experience that no one, no matter how strong a gaslight brought on you, can take away, so long as we have access to this doc.
+ You may see memories from people that don't know you.  That's okay!  You're wonderful people.  If I can talk about abuse in the light to all you guys, you can be brave and talk about a few wonderful moment's you've had, even if you talk about them in front of wonderful friends' wonderful friends.

# Memories
I'll start:

+ The Friendsgiving crew cheltenham friends were the closest thing I had to family in high school.  When Gabe's family sold the house, I felt like I lost my family home.  There was a night we went over and "jammed" aka riley and gabe jammed on piano and that indian accordian thinger (name please), and the rest of us got to sing along and do drum circles.  someone, i think adam, brought out yarn and ran around the room, spinning a web around all of us.  i remember feeling nearly delirious with joy - sincerely internally on the edge of talking in tongues, while onthe outside reminding myself to keep some of that joy to myself, because i didn't want to ruin the moment by making it about me.
    + tagging: Gabe, Riley, Adam, Berliner, Cheltenham kids (encourage you to add an angle and fill in tags!)

+ I asked Riley how to hop from rock to rock when water hiking (my family would never let us do family activities growing up - only watching movies or tv together, or going to my mom's parents' house in toledo were allowed - so I had to learn how to appreciate nature from a combo of middle school PEAK trip (not to be confused with Sam "Don't Tell me What's Real" Kassel's peak trip at the Soltrin cabin)), some curated nature walks at Camp Ramah, and winging it trying to keep up with all you guys' awesome naturing abilities.  Riley looked confused laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and said something along the lines of "uuuh, you kinda just walk!" and laughed.  Thanks for making it a joyous moment instead of one I felt embarassed to ask about
    + Also, asked Riley how to do a flip once, and he told me "try really really really hard."  I, actually really sincerely, use that advice for so many things in life still.  It's a hilariously effective way to teach yourself how to do something.  Thanks, Riley!
